# Clack
Your solution to learning how to type.
Clack helps you learn how to type on a Hebrew Keyboard, but could be extended by anybody who wants to any other language keyboard.

Clack is written in JavaScript (using some **Angular.js**), PHP (for the server, not open source, and therefore not in this repo), Python (for gathering the word list, not included in this repo because it is not necessary to running the website).

This project has basic **Facebook API integration**, alowing you to save your progress through your Facebook account.
